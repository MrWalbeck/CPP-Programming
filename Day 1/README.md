## 📦 Variables in C++

A **variable** is a named container used to store data in memory.

```cpp
int age = 20;        // integer variable
float price = 99.5;  // floating-point variable
char grade = 'A';    // character variable
bool passed = true;  // boolean variable


---

🔹 Keywords in C++

Keywords are reserved words in C++ that cannot be used as identifiers:

int, float, double, char, bool, if, else, while, for, return, void, const, static … etc.

🔢 Data Types & Variable Range

Data Type	Size (Approx)	Range

int	4 bytes	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
float	4 bytes	1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38
double	8 bytes	2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308
char	1 byte	-128 to 127 (ASCII)
bool	1 byte	true / false


> Tip: Always choose the appropriate type for memory efficiency.

➕ Operators

Arithmetic Operators

int a = 10, b = 5;
cout << a + b << endl; // Addition
cout << a - b << endl; // Subtraction
cout << a * b << endl; // Multiplication
cout << a / b << endl; // Division
cout << a % b << endl; // Modulus

Assignment Operator

int x = 5;
x += 3; // x = 8
x -= 2; // x = 6

Precedence of Operators

Multiplication (*) / Division (/) > Addition (+) / Subtraction (-)

Parentheses () have highest precedence


int result = 2 + 3 * 4;      // 14
int correct = (2 + 3) * 4;   // 20

🧮 Examples

Adding Two Integers

int a, b;
cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
cin >> a >> b;
cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;

Using Character

char grade;
cout << "Enter your grade: ";
cin >> grade;
cout << "Your grade: " << grade << endl;


---

⚠️ Integer Overflow Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int maxInt = 2147483647; // maximum int
    cout << maxInt + 1 << endl; // overflow occurs
    return 0;
}


---

🔄 Code Flow

C++ executes statements sequentially, from top to bottom.
Use this understanding to write structured programs.


---

🧪 Practice Tasks

1. Declare different types of variables and print their values.


2. Take two integers from the user and display their sum.


3. Experiment with arithmetic operators and precedence.


4. Try entering values that cause integer overflow.




---

📈 Outcome

After completing Day 1, you should be able to:

Understand C++ variables, keywords, data types, and operators

Write basic programs with proper code flow

Use comments and experiment with integer overflow



---

⭐ Keep coding and enjoy your C++ journey! 🚀

Ye README **final, polished, ready-to-paste** hai **Day 1 folder ke liye**.  

Agar chaho, main **Day 2 aur Day 3 ke READMEs bhi ek hi style me** complete bana doon, ready-to-publish format me.  

Chahte ho main Day 2 aur Day 3 bhi bana doon?

##➕ Operators

##1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators

int a = 10, b = 5;
cout << a + b << endl; // Addition
cout << a - b << endl; // Subtraction
cout << a * b << endl; // Multiplication
cout << a / b << endl; // Division
cout << a % b << endl; // Modulus

##2️⃣ Assignment Operator

int x = 5;
x += 3; // x = 8
x -= 2; // x = 6

##3️⃣ Precedence of Operators

Multiplication (*) / Division (/) > Addition (+) / Subtraction (-)

Parentheses () have highest precedence


int result = 2 + 3 * 4;      // 14, not 20
int correct = (2 + 3) * 4;   // 20
