# 📅 Day 1 — Course Overview, Variables, Data Types & Operators

Welcome to **Day 1** of the *C++ From Scratch for University Students* journey! 🚀  
Today we’ll cover the basics of C++, get familiar with variables, data types, operators, and start coding your first programs.

---

## 🎯 Topics Covered Today

- Variables in C++  
- Keywords in C++  
- Data Types  
- Operators  
- Precedence of Operators  
- Assignment Operator  
- Comments  
- Adding Two Integers  
- Using Characters

---

## 🖥️ Software & Tools

To follow along and practice today's lessons:

- 💻 **PC / Laptop**: Dev C++  
- 📱 **Android Mobile**: Coding C++  

---
## ☃️ First Program

```cpp
// myfirstprogram.cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
}
```
---

## 📦 Variables in C++

A **variable** is a named container used to store data in memory.

```cpp
data_type variable_name = value;
````

### Example

```cpp
int age = 20;
float price = 99.5;
char grade = 'A';
bool passed = true;
```

## 🔢 Data Types in C++

| Data Type | Description      | Example |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| int       | Whole numbers    | 10, -5  |
| float     | Decimal numbers  | 3.14    |
| double    | Larger decimals  | 99.999  |
| char      | Single character | 'A'     |
| bool      | True/False       | true    |
| string    | Text             | "Hello" |

## ➕ Operators in C++

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators

```cpp
int a = 10, b = 5;
cout << a + b << endl;  // 15
cout << a - b << endl;  // 5
cout << a * b << endl;  // 50
cout << a / b << endl;  // 2
cout << a % b << endl;  // 0
```

### 2️⃣ Assignment Operators

```cpp
int a = 5;
a += 3; // a = 8
a -= 2; // a = 6
```

### 3️⃣ Comparison Operators

```cpp
a == b; // equal
a != b; // not equal
a > b;  // greater than
a < b;  // less than
```

### 4️⃣ Logical Operators

```cpp
a > 5 && b < 10; // AND
a > 5 || b < 10; // OR
!true;           // NOT
```

---

## 🧪 Practice Task

- Write a program that takes **two numbers**, performs arithmetic operations, and displays results.
- Experiment with **variables and different data types**.

---

## 📈 Outcome

After completing Day 1, you should be able to:

- Understand course structure
- Declare and use variables
- Work with basic data types
- Perform operations using operators

---

⭐ **Keep coding and enjoy your C++ journey!** 🚀
